<p><h3> My favorite show is Spongebob Squarepants because it is funny and entertaining. I don't have a favorite movie because there are too many good ones to choose from.</p>

  <p><h3>
    Spongebob is a very popular show that has been airing on tv for 22 years(it was first aired in 1999). Spongebob is a great show for the entire family to enjoy.
